# privapoll
A project to keep voting humane and private.

Built on Solana using Rust Anchor to ensure a fair voting process that is Sybil-resistant. While offering a diverse experience for different users, the verification orb of each user is checked, allowing users with higher humanity scores to vote in more important polls, depending on the security level the user set beforehand. The voting process has been deployed on Solana, ensuring a faster and more seamless experience with reduced delays in the voting process.
